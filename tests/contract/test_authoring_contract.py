Component:         Repository integrity contract
Purpose:           Verifies required Task repository structure and configuration.
Interacts With:    Repository integrity checks and the complete Task tree
Sprint/Task:       Sprint 4 — Project 4
Concepts:          Dependency direction, configuration ownership, repository integrity
Tools:             Python 3.12, pytest
